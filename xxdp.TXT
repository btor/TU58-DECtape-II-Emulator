                              RT-11 V5.3

       Installation of RT-11 Version 5.3 is complete and you are now
    executing from the working volume    (provided you have used the
    automatic installation procedure). DIGITAL recommends you verify
    the correct  operation  of  your  system's  software  using  the
    verification procedure.  To do this, enter the command:

                             IND VERIFY

        Note that VERIFY should be performed  only after the distri-
    bution media have been backed up.  This was accomplished as part
    of automatic installation on  all  RL02,  RX02,  TK50, and  RX50
    based systems,   including the  MicroPDP-11 and the Professional
    300.  If you have not completed automatic installation, you must
    perform a manual backup before using VERIFY.  Note also,  VERIFY
    is NOT supported on RX01 diskettes,    DECtape I or II,   or the
    Professional 325.

    DIGITAL also  recommends  you  read  the  file V5NOTE.TXT, which
    contains information  formalized too late to be included  in the
    Release Notes.  V5NOTE.TXT can be TYPED or PRINTED.
